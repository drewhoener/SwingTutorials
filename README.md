#READ EVERY CLASS IN THE TUTORIAL BEFORE RUNNING THE PROGRAM
##This ensures greatest understanding of the material

###Tutorial Order: Each expands on the knowledge of the last, so you'll be lost if you go out of order
#### 1. `frames` package
#### 2. `panels` -> `PanelIntro`
#### 3. `panels` -> `ball` package
#### 4. `panels` -> `pong` package
#### 5. `panels` -> `buildable` package

The `buildable` package leaves a lot for you to find out. There's going to be a **lot** of code, and
a **lot** of methods and runnables. I'll notate some of them but you'll really have to explore
how everything is put together

This is one of the most complex and interjoined projects I've put together (for no reason, the others had a point)

As such, make sure you read through for what little stuff I've left before running, and message me if you have questions
*The formatting for `buildable` is shitty as all hell but it's also 3AM*
